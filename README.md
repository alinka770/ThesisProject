# ThesisProject
This thesis focuses on the analysis of traffic violation data collected by the Israeli traffic police, with the specific objective of analyzing violators and predicting future  violations. Israel has witnessed an alarming increase in traffic fatalities, and the safety of road users is a critical concern. In response to these challenges, the National Road Safety Agency of Israel initiated the development of a new national road safety plan extending until 2030. While some studies have been conducted on the automatic identification of police-gathered data, there is a dearth of research papers focusing specifically on Israeli data. This study aims to address this research gap by analyzing traffic violation data obtained from the Israeli traffic police.

The first part of the research aims to develop profiles for Israeli violators, along with an analysis of the types of violations committed and the prediction of potential future violations. To achieve this, conventional machine-learning techniques are employed for feature selection and classification. The results indicate that the classification accuracy of 77.58% can be achieved with Regression Tree (CART) when distinguishing between violators from Jewish and non-Jewish cities/settlements. Furthermore, decision criteria are established to differentiate between the profiles of violators from Jewish and non-Jewish cities/settlements.

In the second part of the study, the XGB Classifier and Logistic Regression methods are utilized for the analysis of violators, violations, and the prediction of future violations. The XGB classifier demonstrates an accuracy of 83.43% in predicting the religious affiliation of violators.
By shedding light on the profiles and prediction of traffic violators in Israel, this research contributes to enhancing road safety measures and designing targeted interventions to reduce traffic violations. The findings of this study can inform policymakers and law enforcement agencies in formulating effective strategies for improving road safety for all road users.
